package parse

// Do I run transforms on all of the lines? I don't want to run them on comments, but I can filter those out
// It would be better to do it here right, because when I parse I can validate right off
func transform(template string) ([]string, fatal) {
	// Or this filters and returns the string transformed already.
	// It also returns fatals, which are errors in the template (as opposed to internal errors)
}
